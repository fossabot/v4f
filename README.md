# Description :
### V4F

v4f is a javascript library for data validation that encourages rapid development and clean, unlike other validation libraries v4f is designed from the ground up to be adaptable for any context, and it takes care of all your validation in different environments (client, server, native).

You can use  **V4f**  together with ([react.js](https://reactjs.org/),  [angular.js](https://angular.io/),  [vue.js](https://vuejs.org/),  [jquery](https://jquery.com/)) or with any web framework.


###  Why !

why new validation library where they exist several good ones around, sure you are completely right. but the problem with those libraries is that almost all of the theme focus in data validation and they forget the key reason why we do validation for, is that we desire to guide our users by showing them what they missing or what they doing wrong with  some pieces of information, but sadly  you end up with generic messages errors or writing code on  the top of this libraries every time you use them.

**V4F** comes to solve this problem by focusing on those two features validations and failures messages, **V4F** comes with easy and powerful syntax that feels more human that everyone can understand with more than 40+ built-in rules.

##  Out of the box

**Schema** : v4f use the concept of the schema types to indicate your rules that will be checked later were we need it, this notion is powerful it lets you create complex rules ones and use it multiple types.

**Nested Schema** : with v4f you can use a schema that already created inside other schemas to create complex validation.  

**Related Field** : validate fields that related or depends on each other easily with a simple syntax.

**One-field** : Validate only one field from schema very useful in situations like instead field validation feedback.

# Getting started

###  Syntax overview
```javascript
import {Schema, Field, When} from "v4f";

const User = Schema({
 username: Field()
  .string()
  .alphaNum()
  .required({ constraint: When("#email", Field().none()) }),
 email: Field()
  .string()
  .email()
  .required({ constraint: When("#username", Field().none()) }),
 password: Field()
  .string()
  .min(6)
  .max(20)
  .not.equals(["#username"])
  .not.equals(["#email"])
  .required(),
 cPassword: Field()
  .string()
  .equals(["#password"])
  .required()
});

const result = User.validate(data);

```

The above schema defines the following constraints:

-   username :
    -   Must be string
    -   Must be alpha numeric
    -   Required when  **email**  field is not present
    -   Optional when  **email**  field is present
-   email :
    -   Must be string
    -   Must be valid email
    -   Required when  **username**  field is not present
    -   Optional when  **username**  field is present
-   password :
    -   Must be string
    -   At least 6 characters long but no more than 20
    -   Must not be equals to  **username**  and  **email**
    -   Required
-   cPassword :
    -   Must be string
    -   Must equals to  **password**
    -   Required

## Instalation

To install the stable version:
```sh
$ npm install v4f
```
This assumes you are using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as your package manager.

or

```sh
