title: Motivation

As the requirements for javascript applications have become increasingly complicated, our code must manage more validation than ever before. This validation can include complex data structure with related field validation or nested or composed structure.

Managing all validation in your application can become harder if one field depends on the value of other areas and another one as well depends on others fields, at some point, you no longer track what **happens in your code**, and **you will lose control** of your what data is validated.

another issue is that almost all code that contains any **validation is harder to read and understand quickly**, with multiple "if-else, switch" statements and nested condition.

the primary motivation for this project is to **create an active community around this problem**, with robust solutions and easy implementation to **help developers to focus on their application problems** and not wasting a lot of time figuring out how to validate.
